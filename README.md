This is the final project that Nino and I will be doing. Our first step however: work on branches.

2015.5.22: Randy made a woking engine for bouncing balls, complete with balls.
2015.5.23: Randy made the first few levels, as well as bricks and the bouncing bar. He also removed gravity and added the differnt levels to bricks, as well as the isSteel boolean.
2015.5.24: Nino added level three. Randy converted Balls to float instead of int so their bouncing would be more predictable. He also added leveling up and pause. Finally, level 4 was added.
2015.5.25: The impossible level was added by Randy. Randy also added xdir/ydir checking to stop balls from boomeranging around bricks. Later, Randy added two more levels.
2015.5.26: Added .1 to all xdirs to avoid balls bouncing straight up forever.
2015.5.27: Randy authored and Nino merged a fix that checked the ball's height to make scanning faster. Also fixed bug where hitting space while the level is on holds space til level ends. Dropped timer to 4 secondsish. Nino created the powerup class and made methods to allow the powerups to fall and detect when they have been caught by the bar.
2015.5.28: Randy authoured level 8*. Nino changed the shape of the powerups and finished multiball.
2015.5.29: Nino redid the multiball powerup, causing balls to start at the ball and go in different directions rather than a shotgun effect from the paddle. Nino also created a somewhat functional gravity powerup.
2015.6.4: Randy finished gravity.
2015.6.5: Randy added level 9*.
2015.6.7: Randy got lasers and guns working, and added level 10*. Nino finished the catch powerup, the wide powerup, and made adjustments to the catchGot method.
2015.6.8: Randy added Basic 3D using shadows.
2015.6.9: Randy updated 3D by angling the shadows.
2015.6.10: Randy added invert and fixed 3D some more.
2015.6.11: Randy added "FUN" - it makes the screen turn psycadelic for 10 seconds
2015.6.13: Randy fixed a glitch in the levels.
2015.6.14: Randy edited "catch" and dropped lag time by making shadows simpler.

*Levels not added in order
