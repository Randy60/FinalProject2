This is the final project that Nino and I will be doing. Our first step however: work on branches.

We are The Breakers of Bricks, The Crushers of Cinderblocks, The Anihilators of All Generic Stackable Solids

2015.5.22: Randy made a woking engine for bouncing balls, complete with balls.
2015.5.23: Randy made the first few levels, as well as bricks and the bouncing bar. He also removed gravity and added the differnt levels to bricks, as well as the isSteel boolean.
2015.5.24: Nino added level three. Randy converted Balls to float instead of int so their bouncing would be more predictable. He also added leveling up and pause. Finally, level 4 was added.
2015.5.25: The impossible level was added by Randy. Randy also added xdir/ydir checking to stop balls from boomeranging around bricks. Later, Randy added two more levels.
2015.5.26: Added .1 to all xdirs to avoid balls bouncing straight up forever.
2015.5.27: Randy authored and Nino merged a fix that checked the ball's height to make scanning faster. Also fixed bug where hitting space while the level is on holds space til level ends. Dropped timer to 4 secondsish.
2015.5.38: Randy authoured level 8*.
2015.6.5: Randy added level 9*.
2015.6.7: Randy got lasers and guns working, and added level 10*.

*Levels not added in order
